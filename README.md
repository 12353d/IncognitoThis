# IncognitoThis
Instantly open any existing tab in a private window!
Currently available as an extension for Google Chrome and Chromium browsers.

## 🚀 Features
With just a click, open any existing tab in a new incognito window
### 🏃Roadmap
 - This currently opens a new window everytime though there is an existing incognito window. Need to check the feasibility of opening it in a tab
 - As of now, it works one way, i.e, privatizes an existing tab. Would be interesting to open incognito tabs in a normal window
 - Option to incognito these tabs in bulk, currently works for a single tabs
 - Add an option to incognito in the drop-down upon right-clicking on the browser window

## 😇 Why did I build this?
Well, I tend to open shopping sites in incognito to see if there is any price difference.
Also, I read a lot of Medium articles in incognito. It doesn't check for subscription in incognito!

Since there is a lot of `Ctrl + c` and `Ctrl + v` involved in this repetitive task, I thought I could use some extension.
But the already existing ones are very old (no update since years) or doing something fishy.
So I thought, hey, I can build something simple like this and open-source it so that others could contribute from making it go stale and
the users can confidently install this extension.

## 🙌 Contributing
Feel free submit PRs! 😀
I'm a novice in developing extensions and I'm very open to learn good practices in building & architecting this project!
